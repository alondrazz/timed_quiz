# timed_quiz
I built this project to lesrn more about what Javascript does and not give up when things get hard.
I learned how to add JavaScript correctly and also how funtions work.
## Challenges
A challenge I faced off with this challenge was looking for the right resources, there are so many ways on how to solve a problem and how to make the quiz. It really did confuse me and I'm still not really sure how to fix some of the errors or add some of the coding elements.
